<h1>This is a simple Text Analysis application</h1><h5>from Deitel Java 8 exercises</h5>
<p>The availability of computers with string-manipulation capabilities has resulted in some rather interesting approaches to analyzing the writings of great authors. Much attention has been focused on whether William Shakespeare ever lived. Some scholars believe there’s
substantial evidence indicating that Christopher Marlowe actually penned the masterpieces attributed to Shakespeare. Researchers have used computers to find similarities in the writings of these
two authors. This exercise examines three methods for analyzing texts with a computer.</p>

a) Write an application that reads a line of text from the keyboard and prints a table indicating the number of occurrences of each letter of the alphabet in the text. For example,
the phrase

<i>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</i>

b) contains one “a,” two “b’s,” no “c’s,” and so on.
Write an application that reads a line of text and prints a table indicating the number
of one-letter words, two-letter words, three-letter words, and so on, appearing in the
text.

<i>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</i>

c) Write an application that reads a line of text and prints a table indicating the number
of occurrences of each different word in the text. The application should include the
words in the table in the same order in which they appear in the text. For example, the
lines

<i>To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</i>

contain the word “to” three times, the word “be” two times, the word “or” once, etc.
