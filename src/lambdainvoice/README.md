<h1>Manipulating a Stream<Invoice></h1><h5>from Deitel Java 8 exercises</h5>


<p>In this example I demonstrate data manipulation using lambdas and streams.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sort Invoice objects by PartDescription</li>
<li>Sort Invoice object by Price</li>
<li>Map each Invoice to its PartDescription and Quantity, sort results by Quantity</li>
<li>Map each Invoice to its PartDescription and value of the Invoice (Quantity*Price), sort by value</li>
<li>Map each Invoice to its PartDescription and value of the Invoice (Quantity*Price) in range from 200 to 500, sort by value</li>
</ol>
